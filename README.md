# code-quiz

This program is a simple JavaScript knowlodge test that asks the user a series of questions and gives a multiple choice list of answers for the user to answer with by click. The program uses two HTML JavaScript pages that are activated through the use of the game and checking locally stored high scores. 


### Usage

To begin the game the user should read the instructions and then click the start test button. A 100 second timer starts, and the user is presented with a question that must be answered through clicking on one of the answers. If answered correctly the user is told that the answer was correct and then the next question is displayed. If the user answers incorrectly 10 seconds is decucted from the reaming time, the user is told the answer is incorrect, and the next question is presented. after all of the questions are answered or the time runs out the user is presented with their score(the time remaining when the game ends) and the number of questions answered correctly out of the toal number of questions. The user is then asked to input their initials so that their score can be stored locally. User high scores can be viewed by clicking the High Scores link at the top left of the webpage. High scores can be cleared by clicking the clear scores button.
